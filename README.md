# Be Heard
Make Your Voice Loud

![Black Lives Matter](https://github.com/Jagod101/BeHeard/blob/gh-pages/images/logo-black-lives-matter.png)

### Mission
During these times, no voice should be left unheard. Speak out for what **YOU** believe is right. Come together as a **COMMUNITY**. This is America, this is **OUR HOME**. Say it loud, _**BE HEARD**_

Use this as a resource to find out more such as:
- National County Curfew Times
- Bail Funds
- Official GoFundMe Pages to help those affected
- Peaceful Protest Locations

I encourage you to also use **#BeHeard** to highlight the PEACEFUL PROTESTS happening in this country. We will not let our PRESIDENT label us as terrorists.
